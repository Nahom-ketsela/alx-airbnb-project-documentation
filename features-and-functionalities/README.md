# Airbnb Clone Backend: Features and Functionalities

This document outlines the key features and functionalities required for the Airbnb Clone backend, a RESTful API-driven application designed to mimic the core functionality of Airbnb. The backend supports user management, property listings, bookings, payments, and more, ensuring a scalable, secure, and efficient system.

## Core Functionalities

### 1. User Management
- **User Registration**: Users can sign up as guests or hosts using email and password, with secure authentication via JWT. OAuth options (e.g., Google, Facebook) are supported.
- **User Login and Authentication**: Secure login with email/password and OAuth. JWT ensures session security.
- **Profile Management**: Users can update profiles with details like photos, contact info, and preferences.

### 2. Property Listings Management
- **Add Listings**: Hosts can create property listings with details such as title, description, location, price, amenities, and availability.
- **Edit/Delete Listings**: Hosts can update or remove their listings.

### 3. Search and Filtering
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search properties by location, price range, number of guests, and amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly).
- **Pagination**: Large datasets are paginated for efficient retrieval.

### 4. Booking Management
- **Booking Creation**: Guests can book properties for specific dates, with validation to prevent double bookings.
- **Booking Cancellation**: Guests and hosts can cancel bookings per the cancellation policy.
- **Booking Status**: Track statuses like pending, confirmed, canceled, or completed.

### 5. Payment Integration
- **Secure Payments**: Integrate gateways like Stripe or PayPal for upfront guest payments and automatic host payouts.
- **Multi-Currency Support**: Handle transactions in multiple currencies.

### 6. Reviews and Ratings
- **Guest Reviews**: Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties, linked to specific bookings.
- **Host Responses**: Hosts can respond to reviews.

### 7. Notifications System
- **Email and In-App Notifications**: Notify users about booking confirmations, cancellations, and payment updates via email (e.g., SendGrid) and in-app alerts.

### 8. Admin Dashboard
- **Management Interface**: Admins can monitor and manage users, listings, bookings, and payments.

## Technical Requirements
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with tables for Users, Properties, Bookings, Reviews, and Payments.
- **API**: RESTful APIs (or GraphQL) using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **Authentication**: JWT for secure sessions, with role-based access control (RBAC) for guests, hosts, and admins.
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 or Cloudinary for property images and profile photos.
- **Error Handling**: Global error handling and logging for APIs.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability**: Modular architecture with load balancers for horizontal scaling.
- **Security**: Encrypt sensitive data, implement firewalls, and use rate limiting.
- **Performance**: Use Redis for caching and optimize database queries.
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests with pytest and automated API testing.
